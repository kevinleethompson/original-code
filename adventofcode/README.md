## Here are some festive programming-related holiday hashtags I made:
 #PythonInAPearTree
 
 #TheFirstNoSQL
 
 #DoYouC++WhatIC++
 
 #GodRustYouMerryGentleman
 
 #BabyItsCodeOutside
 
 #ChestnutsLoadedFromAnOpenFile
 
 #WinterWonderLAN
 
 #ISawMommyKissingFunctionCalls
 
 #HesWritingAScriptCheckingItTwiceOperationNotSupportedIncompatibleTypes

I'm back in 2023 to try to actually finish AoC this year. Will either do it all in C or Odin. I'm going to resist the strong urge to delete the corny hashtags above. "ISawMommyKissingFunctionCalls"? wtf does that even mean?
